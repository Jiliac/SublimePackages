v0.3.0 (2014-03-08)
-------------------

- All "package" related files were moved to a sub-directory

  As a result you may see a popup that the "(S)CSScheme" syntax could not be
  found because Sublime cached the old path. If you encounter a CSScheme file
  without syntax highlighting, just close and reopen it or select "Set Syntax:
  SCSScheme" in the command palette.


- Differentiate between style and options list ("fontStyle" vs e.g.
  "tagsOptions") for validation (also #2)
- Allow `"fontStyle": none;` for empty style list (#4)
- Highlight SASS's `index` function
- Fix not showing error message if a line number was not found from the compiled
  SCSS (within the last x lines)
- Add snippets for `@for`, `@each`, `@else if`, `@else`, `@while`
